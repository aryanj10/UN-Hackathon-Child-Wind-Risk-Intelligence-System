# 🌪️ CW-RIS: Child Wind Risk Intelligence System

**CW-RIS** is a child-centered wind risk analysis app that overlays real-time ECMWF ERA5 wind forecast data with child population exposure (e.g., from WorldPop), school density, and hospital accessibility to compute and visualize risk zones. This Streamlit app enables faster, data-driven decisions for humanitarian response and preparedness.

---

## 🚀 What This App Does

- ✅ Downloads live 10m wind forecast data (U & V components) from ECMWF ERA5 via CDS API
- ✅ Computes wind speed magnitude from U and V components
- ✅ Clips and reprojects child population raster to match wind data
- ✅ Multiplies wind × population to produce a child wind risk raster
- ✅ Aggregates exposure using zonal statistics (by admin boundaries)
- ✅ Enhances risk by factoring in school density and hospital proximity
- ✅ Displays an interactive map with high-risk areas highlighted

## 🛠️ Features

- 📡 **Live ERA5 Wind Data** via Copernicus CDS API
- 💨 **Wind Magnitude Calculation**: `sqrt(U^2 + V^2)`
- 👶 **Child Exposure Mapping** using population rasters
- 🏫 **School Density Scoring** using HDX education site data
- 🏥 **Hospital Accessibility Scoring** using proximity buffers
- 🗺️ **Zonal Risk Statistics** per admin region
- 🖱️ **Interactive Map** with hover tooltips (Leafmap/Folium)
- 📈 **Final Composite Risk Score** for decision support

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔑 Setup: CDS API Key

1.  Register at https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu
2.  Go to your CDS API page
3.  Save your credentials in a `.cdsapirc` file in your home directory:

```yaml
url: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api
key: your_uid:your_api_key
```

---

## ▶️ Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open in your browser at: http://localhost:8501

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Fetch latest wind forecast (5-day lag)
2. Compute wind speed using U and V components
3. Reproject child population to match wind raster
4. Compute wind × population exposure per pixel
5. Aggregate by admin regions (zonal stats)
6. Adjust risk by school density and hospital proximity
7. Display interactive map with composite risk scores

---

## 📊 Example Outputs

- Table ranking admin regions by Final Risk Score
- Interactive map:
  - Color-coded composite risk zones
  - Highlighted highest-risk areas
  - Hover to view region risk breakdown

---

## Notes

- All spatial layers are assumed in `EPSG:4326`
- Requires valid CDS API credentials and recent Python packages
- Raster alignment done using `rasterio.reproject()`

---

## Future Plans

- Add flood and landslide hazard overlays
- Connect to CCRI-DRM dashboards via GeoTIFF
- Enable time-based risk forecasting
- Extend for regional/global scalability
